                How Is Treaty 2 Being Implemented Today?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Treaty 2 covers a special area in southern Manitoba and parts of Saskatchewan, including the land between Lake Manitoba, 
                <span style="color:  rgb(255, 160, 45); font-weight: 550;">Winnipeg</span>, and <span style="color:  rgb(255, 160, 45); font-weight: 550;">Dauphin Lake</span>. The area is rich in natural resources like good soil, forests, and waterways, 
                which made it valuable to both the Canadian government and Indigenous peoples for farming and transportation. <br/><br/><br/>
                Long Plain First Nation has similar urban reserves with gas stations and education centers that create jobs and support the community.
                These communities are also improving their economies by building new homes, upgrading roads, and developing tourist attractions that highlight their culture. <br/><br/><br/>
                Some are managing natural resources like forests and mines to benefit financially while caring for the land. Farming projects are helping to produce local food and create jobs.
                The Treaty 2 Government is working to gain more control over education, health care, and land management so they can make decisions that help their
                communities thrive and maintain their cultural identity.<br/><br/>
